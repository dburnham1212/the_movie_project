# The Movie Project

The movie project is a client based application that makes use of TMDB, an API used to retrieve information about different items within the entertainment industry. It is a project that I created in order to learn the Angular framework. It doesnt make use of any CSS libraries as I also wanted to improve my abilities in CSS or more specifically SASS as a whole.
